                he Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL are the best argument that specs don’t tell you everything you need to know about a phone — because the experience of using a Pixel 4 is better than any other Android phone.

            <p class="text">
                There is a nuanced difference between saying “specs don’t tell you the whole story” and “specs don’t matter,” because they absolutely do — if only because the wrong ones can ruin the whole thing. There are a few places where Google could have done better,
                especially with battery life. But overall the Pixel 4 hits enough of the marks to pass, and it’s a few new features from Google that push the experience ahead of the pack.

                The Pixel 4 starts at $799 for the smaller 5.7-inch screen version with 64GB of storage. I suspect many users will pay the $100 for the XL version with the bigger screen, the $100 more for 128GB of storage, or both. I am sympathetic to arguments that the specs don’t quite justify those prices, but only to a point. With the Pixel 4, the cost isn’t about the hardware — it’s about Google’s software, camera, and those new features.

                Most new phones try to layer on one or two new features year over year. But the Pixel 4 has at least five major new hardware-based features: face unlock, Motion Sense, the new Google Assistant, the new 90Hz display, and a second telephoto camera lens. It’s also available on all four major US carriers for the first time.

                oogle completely changed the design language of the Pixel this year. If I had to pick a standout design element, I’d go with the aluminum rail around the edge. It’s painted black metal, rounded simply with a matte finish. That helps significantly with grip but also makes it stand out — the rails are black whether you have the black, orange, or white model. Something about the look reminds me of thick, heavy Buddy Holly-style eyeglasses.

                Even though the Pixel 4 shares the iPhone 11’s square camera bump, the overall design and aesthetic is unique and feels of a piece with the Pixel’s lineage. Google is leaning into the contrasts of its material and colors instead of trying to meld them into something that feels like a single whole.
            </p>

            All three colors have Gorilla Glass 5 on the back, but the white and orange models have matte finishes, and I much prefer them to the glossy finish on the black model. The orange has coral tones to it, depending on the light, and it’s also limited-edition for some reason.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
            After releasing a phone with a hilariously huge notch last year, Google is going back to a notchless, big top bezel design. That’s ostensibly so it can fit both its face unlock and radar sensors up top, but I do wonder if Google just wanted to make life easier on itself this time around. I don’t mind the look, but it does mean the front of the phone is asymmetrical: the top, bottom, and sides all have different bezel widths. You’ll notice it and then you will stop noticing it and then it will be fine.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                There are some nice small details, though. The corner radiuses on the screen are larger and actually come closer to matching the radiuses on the phone itself (they even subtly cut off 21:9 video, just like on the iPhone 11 Pro). The power button has a nice pop of color on it.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                The Pixel 4 does not have a headphone jack, of course, but it does at least have a USB-C port that doesn’t require headphone makers to pay a licensing fee to access. Weirdly and annoyingly, Google doesn’t include either headphones or an adapter in the box anywhere except France and Australia.

                n a technical level, the new face unlock feature works very much like the iPhone’s Face ID does. It has a projector that shoots out a broad array of infrared dots, and cameras that see those dots. It works in any lighting condition, and you can’t trick it with a photograph or a video like you can on Samsung or OnePlus’ face unlock systems (I tried).

                The Pixel 4’s method may be more secure than other Android-based face unlock technology, but it’s not as secure as Apple’s — yet. The Pixel 4 doesn’t care if your eyes are open or closed, which means that somebody could unlock your phone by holding it up to your face as you slumber.

Unfortunately, the only timeline it would give is “in the coming months.” In the meanwhile, the most secure choice to lock a Pixel 4 remains a long passcode. The other option is remembering to turn on and hit the “lockdown” button in the power menu if you’re concerned somebody might try to unlock it with your face.

                Face unlock works just like the fingerprint sensor did for biometric authentication — it maps to unlocking, authorizing purchases, and so on — or at least it should once more apps update to support it. But it is wildly more convenient and easy to use. It feels completely seamless and I don’t ever want to go back to any kind of fingerprint sensor, in-screen or wherever else.
